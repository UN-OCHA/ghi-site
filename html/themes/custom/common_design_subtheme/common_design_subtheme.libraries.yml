    # This is not technically a dependency, but on pages that have no visible
    # element using cd-tables, but at least one hidden, not having this already
    # loaded breaks the frontend customization feature. The reason seems to be,
    # that the polyfill is only loaded in IE and ignored in all other browsers,
    # and the logic that loads the dependencies during an ajax call, can't
    # finish the promise to load all dependencies.
    # So the easy solution is to just include it in every page, so that the
    # ajax process doesn't need to require it again.
    # @see /core/misc/ajax.js add_js method for where that promise is setup.
