The crisis continues unabated, and affected people’s living conditions are not improving; they still live with great unpredictability, privation far beyond chronic poverty, and daily threats to their health and safety. Crude mortality rates among people arriving from some inaccessible areas are at war-time levels. Food security[1] has improved somewhat, and cautious optimism about the course of the conflict was generated by the ‘surrender’ or escape in mid-2021 of some thousands of ‘fighters’ from non-State armed groups (NSAGs), though the majority are women and children. However, as attacks by NSAGs continue at scale, peace or true stabilization across most of the conflict-affected zones is not yet in sight. </p>\n\n<p>Protection needs are formidable, especially for women and girls, who still lack adequate protection and access to justice and services, and are at risk of violence, abduction, rape, gender-based violence, forced and child marriage, and other violations of their rights. Children are also at risk as unaccompanied and separated minors, and when formerly associated with armed groups, forced recruitment is a further risk. </p></gho-footnotes-text></div>\n\n      </div>\n"

She was displaced from Mafa in 2016 due to the ongoing violence in north-east Nigeria. She trekked to Gongulong for safety and has lived there ever since. Last year, FAO gave her four goats and trained her to care for them. They have since multiplied to eight. But raising her livestock is not without challenges. She explains: “The climate is changing. The dry season is longer and very hot. It affects everything: our environment, our livelihoods and our animals. Before, rain started early and lasted long. Now rainfall is short, it does not start early, but it ends early. Before, we had a high crop yield and enough grass for animals to feed. Now the crop yield is less and there is sparse vegetation. It even affects the trees. There is not enough food, not enough water, not enough animal feed and not enough firewood. It is hard to get water for my animals, the feeding is more expensive, and the heat has caused some goats to have miscarriages. So, we also have to engage in small trade, buying and selling.”</p>\n          <span class=\"gho-caption__credits\">OCHA/Damilola Onafuwa</span>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      </div>\n"

Security has improved incrementally in parts of Adamawa and Yobe States. Humanitarian hubs and aid organizations’ offices have suffered regular attacks in 2021. Conflict and insecurity continue to cut people off from their main means of livelihoods, agricultural lands. This causes major food insecurity in north-east Nigeria. Protection and livelihoods are linked: women’s and adolescents’ livelihoods tend to be the most fragile, and females are at greater risk of negative coping mechanisms, such as sex work for food or for other survival needs. Boys in desperation are more easily lured into NSAGs. </p>\n\n<p>Humanitarian funding for Nigeria has been in steady decline since its peak in 2017. Therefore, the Humanitarian Country Team’s new two-year humanitarian strategy must make the most of limited resources and capacity. It will ensure this is done collectively – that humanitarian action in the north-east is more than the sum of its parts. The strategy’s coherence, improved targeting based on vulnerability, and prioritization aim to mitigate expected funding shortfalls. </p></gho-footnotes-text></div>\n\n      </div>\n"

In parallel, despite near certainty that the conflict and insecurity will continue, it is time to focus on the opportunities (albeit limited) to move some affected people progressively out of crisis. </p>\n\n<p>This strategy is largely one of prioritization, in order to focus funding and implementation on life-saving actions and the most vulnerable people first. The prioritization process in north-east Nigeria focuses on those LGAs and people with multiple severe needs, as identified by the MSNA’s inter-sectoral composites of indicators. The sectors will collaborate on challenges that require concerted actions (e.g. communicable disease control). As a secondary priority, actions will address the critical causes of life-threatening conditions.
