In essence, it is a global snapshot of the current and future trends in humanitarian action for a large-scale resource mobilization effort as well as for exploring opportunities to deliver humanitarian assistance better. </p>\n\n<p>The GHO covers humanitarian needs and operations in different regions and countries whose total number varies every year, and it is usually related to the most acute crises. </p>\n\n<p>The objective of this report is to provide donors, humanitarian workers as well as the general public with an overview of the achievements made in the past year, and also with the challenges still to face in the upcoming one. Besides, it informs about the funds received throughout the year. It is also illustrated with stories depicting how humanitarian aid changes the lives of people in need.</p></gho-footnotes-text></div>\n\n      </div>\n"

The enhanced HPC package was rolled out in 2019 with a view to improve the relevance and effectiveness of the response, increase the quality and usefulness of needs analysis to inform decision -making, enable more meaningful monitoring of needs and results, and reflect global perspectives from the World Humanitarian Summit and Grand Bargain commitments. </p></gho-footnotes-text></div>\n\n      </div>\n"

With this purpose, humanitarian actors apply the Joint Intersectoral Analysis Framework, which provides a common analytical framework to gather, structure, and synthesize information on the intersectoral needs of populations in crisis. The resulting outcomes are summarized in the HNO. </p>\n\n<p>Needs assessment and analysis provides the evidence base for strategic planning, as well as the baseline information upon which situation and response monitoring rely. The HRP is based on the joint analysis of needs and response options with the goal of developing strategic and operational plans. All <a href=\"https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/coordination/clusters/global\" target=\"_blank\">clusters/sectors, </a>such as Food Security, Health, Nutrition, Education, etc., are included in this process providing relevant data and information. </p>\n\n<p>The HRP also serves as a tool to inform advocacy and support fundraising by highlighting the situation and need for the international community, in particular donors. </p></gho-footnotes-text></div>\n\n      </div>\n"
