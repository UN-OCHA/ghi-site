This will be done through multi-sectoral, rights-based interventions, including: the improvement of registrations and civil status documentation, the enhancement of self-reliance through Vocational Skills Trainings (VSTs) and other livelihood programmes, the promotion of refugee access to basic national services such as healthcare and education, and the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for refugee protection, in conjunction with the federal government.</p>\n\n<h3>Multi-Sectoral Assistance for Non-Refugees</h3>\n\n<p>In 2018, the overall humanitarian response will be more focused towards a multi-sectoral approach. Numerous interventions which began in 2017 will carry on, serving to ensure that service delivery is people-centric. These include the continued deployment of Integrated Emergency Response Teams (IERTs), the continued usage of the Drought Operations Control Centres (DOCCs), the re-emphasizing of Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA) as an integrated solution, and the movement towards nutrition-sensitive (as opposed to nutrition-specific) programming.</p>\n",
